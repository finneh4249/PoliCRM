# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Briefly describe:

- What this project is
- Why it exists
- Who it serves
- Current maturity level (prototype, MVP, production, etc.)

Example:

> This project is a lightweight CRM and campaign operations platform designed for political and community organizations.  
> Priorities are reliability, operator speed, maintainability, and minimizing admin overhead.

# Core Principles

## 1. Optimize for Maintainability

- Prefer simple systems over clever systems
- Reduce hidden complexity
- Minimize framework magic
- Keep dependencies lean
- Avoid premature abstraction

## 2. Preserve Operator Clarity

The human operator must always be able to:

- understand system state
- debug failures quickly
- override automation manually
- inspect data directly

Prefer transparency over elegance.

## 3. Minimize Cognitive Load

When designing features:

- reduce moving parts
- reduce configuration burden
- reduce required tribal knowledge
- reduce onboarding time

## 4. Bias Toward Incremental Delivery

Prefer:

- small deployable changes
- iterative improvements
- reversible decisions
- thin vertical slices

Avoid massive rewrites unless unavoidable.

# AI Agent Instructions

## General Behaviour

When working on this project:

- Think step-by-step
- Do not make assumptions about hidden architecture
- Read existing code before proposing major changes
- Match existing project conventions unless explicitly improving them
- Explain tradeoffs clearly
- Ask clarifying questions only when necessary
- Prefer actionable output over theoretical discussion

## Coding Expectations

Before writing code:

1. Identify the relevant files
2. Understand the current architecture
3. Check for existing utilities/helpers
4. Reuse patterns where sensible

When writing code:

- Write clear, readable code
- Prefer explicitness over cleverness
- Keep functions focused
- Avoid deep nesting
- Add comments only where they provide real value
- Do not over-engineer

After writing code:

- Review for edge cases
- Check naming consistency
- Check for dead code
- Verify error handling
- Consider operational impact

# Architecture Preferences

## Preferred Traits

- Stateless where possible
- Idempotent operations
- Clear boundaries
- Explicit data flow
- Composable modules
- Predictable behaviour

## Avoid

- Hidden side effects
- Excessive abstraction
- Tight coupling
- Magic auto-discovery systems
- Overly dynamic architectures
- Unnecessary microservices

# Decision Framework

When multiple approaches are possible, prioritize:

1. Reliability
2. Simplicity
3. Maintainability
4. Operational visibility
5. Performance
6. Developer convenience

---

# Documentation Standards

All major systems should include:

- Purpose
- Inputs/outputs
- Failure modes
- Operational considerations
- Deployment notes
- Recovery procedures

Prefer documentation that helps future maintainers make decisions.

---

# Error Handling Philosophy

Errors should:

- Fail loudly in development
- Fail safely in production
- Produce actionable logs
- Preserve debuggability

Avoid silently swallowing exceptions.

---

# Logging Standards

Logs should:

- Include contextual metadata
- Help reconstruct failures
- Be human-readable
- Avoid noise spam
- Avoid leaking secrets

Important actions should be traceable.

---

# Security Expectations

Never:

- hardcode secrets
- commit credentials
- trust client input blindly
- expose internal stack traces publicly

Always:

- validate inputs
- sanitize outputs
- use least-privilege access
- assume hostile input

---

# Performance Philosophy

Do not optimize prematurely.

First optimize for:

- correctness
- clarity
- maintainability

Only optimize performance after identifying real bottlenecks.

Measure before optimizing.

---

# Git & Change Management

Prefer:

- small commits
- focused PRs
- descriptive commit messages
- reversible migrations

Avoid mixing unrelated concerns in one change.

---

# Testing Expectations

Critical paths should have:

- automated tests where practical
- reproducible validation steps
- clear failure signals

When tests are absent:

- provide manual verification steps

---

# UI/UX Principles

Interfaces should prioritize:

- clarity
- speed
- accessibility
- low friction
- predictable behaviour

Avoid unnecessary animations or visual complexity.

---

# Operational Philosophy

This project should remain operable under:

- degraded conditions
- partial outages
- operator fatigue
- imperfect documentation
- constrained resources

Design for real-world operational resilience.

---

# Communication Style

When explaining technical decisions:

- be concise
- avoid unnecessary jargon
- explain reasoning clearly
- surface tradeoffs honestly

Prefer practical recommendations.

---

# Anti-Patterns

Avoid introducing:

- unnecessary dependencies
- giant god-objects
- fragile implicit coupling
- premature scalability architecture
- hidden business logic
- configuration sprawl

---

# Preferred Output Format

When proposing implementation work:

1. Summary
2. Risks
3. Proposed approach
4. Files affected
5. Implementation steps
6. Validation steps
7. Follow-up improvements

---

# Project Context Rules

If project context is incomplete:

- state assumptions explicitly
- avoid hallucinating architecture
- prefer asking targeted questions over inventing systems

---

# Long-Term Goal

Build systems that:

- survive maintenance turnover
- remain understandable over time
- degrade gracefully
- can evolve incrementally
- reduce operational burden
- maximize real-world usefulness
